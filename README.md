Most of the code is sourced from https://github.com/paperboi/kindle2notion while the NLP elements were inspired by https://realpython.com/nltk-nlp-python/.

The code make uses of the unofficial Notion API to load clippings (highlights and notes) from my Amazon Kindle account. Once loaded, I analyse the clippings to get an idea of what has been standing out to me in recent weeks.
