I gradually learned that prices reflect people’s expectations, so they go up when actual results are better than expected and they go down when they are worse than expected. And most people tend to be biased by their recent experiences.

Think about it: It’s senseless to have making money as your goal as money has no intrinsic value—its value comes from what it can buy, and it can’t buy everything. It’s smarter to start with what you really want, which are your real goals, and then work back to what you need to attain them. Money will be one of the things you need, but it’s not the only one and certainly not the most important one once you get past having the amount you need to get what you really want.

In my early years, I looked up to extraordinarily successful people, thinking that they were successful because they were extraordinary. After I got to know such people personally, I realized that all of them—like me, like everyone—make mistakes, struggle with their weaknesses, and don’t feel that they are particularly special or great. They are no happier than the rest of us, and they struggle just as much or more than average folks. Even after they surpass their wildest dreams, they still experience more struggle than glory.

but there is no shortage of senior (and not so senior) bankers who are unfamiliar with the product characteristics of some of the instruments on their balance sheet. When we say “understanding” we mean: • The product’s contractual cash flows, their pattern, and timing; • The cash flows’ sensitivity (if any) to changes in external and/or relevant market parameters such as interest rates, foreign exchange (FX) rates, inflation, credit rating, and so on; • The cash flows’ sensitivity to customer behaviour; • The cash flows’ sensitivity to factors impacting the bank itself.

Actually, the proper and intellectually robust way to do this is the other way around: the bank should determine its strategy and business model, as well as preparing budgets based on the risk exposure that it considers it has the expertise to manage. This process then drives the level of capital and regulatory capital that the bank should then set up.

Most people have a tough time reflecting when they are in pain and they pay attention to other things when the pain passes, so they miss out on the reflections that provide the lessons. If you can reflect well while you’re in pain (which is probably too much to ask), great. But if you can remember to reflect after it passes, that’s valuable too.

Example 4.5 Exchange cross-rates Consider the following two spot rates: EUR/USD 1.0566–1.0571 AUD/USD 0.7034–0.7039 The EUR/USD dealer buys euros and sells dollars at 1.0566 (the left side), while the AUD/USD dealer sells Australian dollars and buys US dollars at 0.7039 (the right side). To calculate the rate at which the bank buys euros and sells Australian dollars, we need: EUR/USD 1.0566–1.0571 AUD/USD 0.7034–0.7039 The EUR/USD dealer buys euros and sells dollars at 1.0566 (the left side), while the AUD/USD dealer sells Australian dollars and buys US dollars at 0.7039 (the right side). To calculate the rate at which the bank buys euros and sells Australian dollars, we need: 1.0566/0.7039= 1.4997 which is the rate at which the bank buys euros and sells Australian dollars.

When a problem stems from your own lack of talent or skill, most people feel shame. Get over it. I cannot emphasize this enough: Acknowledging your weaknesses is not the same as surrendering to them. It’s the first step toward overcoming them. The pains you are feeling are “growing pains” that will test your character and reward you as you push through them.

Distinguish proximate causes from root causes. Proximate causes are typically the actions (or lack of actions) that lead to problems, so they are described with verbs (I missed the train because I didn’t check the train schedule). Root causes run much deeper and they are typically described with adjectives (I didn’t check the train schedule because I am forgetful). You can only truly solve your problems by removing their root causes, and to do that, you must distinguish the symptoms from the disease.

The yields of government bonds from the shortest maturity instrument to the longest set the benchmark for yields for all other debt instruments in the market, around which all debt instruments are priced. What does this mean? Essentially, it means that if a government 5-year bond is trading at a yield of 5.00%, all other 5-year bonds, whoever they are issued by, will be issued at a yield over 5.00%. The amount over 5.00% that the other bond trades is known as the spread. Therefore, issuers of debt use the yield curve to price bonds and all other debt instruments
